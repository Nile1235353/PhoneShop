                    <h2 class="bold smart">Smartphones</h2>
                    <h2 class="bold smart">Headphones and amplifiers</h2>

The phone played music in real-time to the HA-2 (via the included Android micro USB cable or iOS lightning cable, or USB cable if from PC). It also can be charged using an included "rapid charger" charging kit. The battery pack feature can only be used simultaneously while the HA-2 is used to play music if the playing (source) device is an Apple iOS device.

                    <h2 class="bold smart">Smartwatches</h2>
                    <p>Oppo launched its first smartwatch, the OPPO Watch, on 6 March 2020 in the Chinese domestic market. The next year, they followed up with the OPPO Watch 2, then in 2022 with the Watch 3 Pro, and in 2024 with the Watch 4 Pro.[15]</p>
                    <h2 class="bold smart">Research and development</h2>
                    <p>VOOC (Voltage Open Loop Multi-step Constant-Current Charging) is a proprietary fast charging method unveiled in 2014 by Oppo. It is unique among fast charging methods in that both the cable and charger needed to utilize its potential are proprietary. It is primarily employed in brands of mobile products under the umbrella of its parent company BBK Electronics.[1][16][17] As of February 2023, VOOC implementation is exclusive to brands closely associated with Oppo.[1] Some Oppo devices support USB-PD chargers, however USB-PD devices can not fast charge from VOOC chargers.[18]

                        VOOC is implemented in other brands under the BBK Electronics umbrella. Although marketed under different names, the only difference lies in the name. For example, OnePlus calls it Warp [19][20] The interchangeability is not endorsed by the respective brands and cross operability may be voided anytime in the future.[1]
                        
                        As of 2022, VOOC / SuperVOOC comes in a few variations:</p>
